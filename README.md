# Le Monde de Slou
## This is a static blog made for my class using only HTML and CSS.
For this assignement, I had to do a static website as my very first website. HTML and CSS were the only langages that I had to use.
<br>
So I had to learn those langages within the month of September to deposit my website on October.

## Theme of the website :
I wanted to make something simple and modern with a bit what I like : some japanese stuff, pixel arts, etc

## Tree structure :
I decided to organize my folders like this :
<li>A folder with all my css files</li>
<li>Another one with the images i used as backround for my pages</li>
<li>And the final one with the HTML pages in it</li>

## Website structure : 
As you can see if you've download the files, my website is organized like this :
<li>An index page where there is just the name of the website, with a sticky header to have access to the other pages and a footer with the links to my social medias</li>
<li>A topic index, to have access to the topics I had to write for the presentation.</li>
<li>2 pages of topics</li>
<li>A "about me" page, a "contact" page and a "career" page. But i didn't have time to finish those.</li>
<li>Finally, a "source" page, with all the sources I relayed on for my topics or the images that I use.</li>

## Access : 
If you're reading this, it means you have access to my files, it is a website made from scratch, if you want to use my code for your personnal use, feel free to do so.
